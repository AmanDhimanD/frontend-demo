# Demo-Front Library

Demo-Front is a powerful library that provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing data in your projects. This library simplifies the process of handling data operations and allows you to focus on building your application.

## Installation

To install the Demo-Front library, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to your project's directory.
3. Run the following command to install the library using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install demo-front
```

or

```bash
yarn add demo-front
```

The library and its dependencies will be downloaded and installed into your project.

## Usage

Once the Demo-Front library is installed, you can use it in your project. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Import the necessary functions from the library in your project file:

```javascript
import { useCRUD } from 'demo-front';
```

2. Initialize the CRUD functionality by invoking the `useCRUD` function:

```javascript
const { data, createItem, readItem, updateItem, deleteItem } = useCRUD();
```

3. Use the imported functions to perform CRUD operations. Here are some examples:

- Create a new item:
```javascript
createItem({ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' });
```

- Read an item by its ID:
```javascript
const item = readItem(1);
```

- Update an item by its ID:
```javascript
updateItem(1, { name: 'Updated Item' });
```

- Delete an item by its ID:
```javascript
deleteItem(1);
```

Make sure to adapt the code examples to your specific use case and data structure.

## Example

Here's an example of how you can integrate the Demo-Front library into your project:

```javascript
import { useCRUD } from 'demo-front';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, createItem, readItem, updateItem, deleteItem } = useCRUD();

  // Example usage
  createItem({ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' });
  const item = readItem(1);
  updateItem(1, { name: 'Updated Item' });
  deleteItem(1);

  return (
    // Your component JSX code
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

In this example, we import the `useCRUD` function from the Demo-Front library and use it within the `MyComponent` component to perform CRUD operations on the `data` array.

Feel free to adapt the example code to your project's needs and provide additional documentation as necessary.
